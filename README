- bugs, misc
  - it's 'vorlauf' not 'vourlauf'. :p
  - std.fmt.date.ymdhm should omit the 'hm' if the hour is exactly midnight.
  - 500/404 page handling
  x /user/{user}/brew/{id}?type={type} doesn't work.
  x with validation error on step addition, the form is correctly populated, but collapsed

- shitty things
  - recipe_new()
  - brew()
    - way too deep/nested
  - "next_possible_step[s]" logic, including future-dated steps
    - semi-duplicated between model and (view) brew()
  - toggled <div> py:attrs style form mumble.

- calendaring

  x next step types += first future step for update

  x add step form takes into account first future step

  - if a "future" action gets updated in time, what happens to other future actions after it?
    - nothing
    - they're moved forward in time by the same delta-T they had before the update (nifty, but maybe wrong.)
      - then make it some policy of the type of future step?  Ferm vs. keg vs. …?
    - make them all immediately after the new step.

  - encourage future steps visually, … how?
    - when adding a 'pitch' step, prompt to add future steps for 'ferm1' and 'ferm2'
    - when adding 'starter', prompt for 'strike-water', 'ferm1', 'ferm2', &c.…

  - "standard" ferm schedules?
    - 1 wk primary, 2 wk secondary
    - style-based?

  x add "future" sub-body to table
    - visually/functionally distinct how?

- shopping list

    x add -> first form elt
    _ GET after POST of {grain, hop, …} -> [add] button on same form.

Weirdness
---------

- when journaling after racking to secondary, is it entered as primary-ferm or secondary-ferm?
