Bugs
----
x Recipe* amounts can't be sub-integer, which makes it hard to have "0.5 oz" of hops. :(

Weirdness
---------
- when journaling after racking to secondary, is it entered as primary-ferm or secondary-ferm?

Later

- shopping list
  - http://beeradvocate.com/forum/read/1102362#1102497

- alerts
  - keg now.
  - have you racked this week?

- comments
  - OpenID support

- widget-style embedding
  - brew overview
  - upcoming brews

- recipe
  - browser
  - clone from other URL
  - star from other URL

- import/export

- add 'equipment'/'rig'

- use the following style of the Google Reader "note this URL" bookmarklet for on-the-web recipe induction:
    javascript:
    var b=document.body;
    var GR________bookmarklet_domain='http://www.google.com';
    if(b&&!document.xmlVersion){
    void(z=document.createElement('script'));
    void(z.src='http://www.google.com/reader/ui/link-bookmarklet.js');
    void(b.appendChild(z));
    }
    else{}
