- bugs

  - /user/{user}/brew/{id}?type={type} doesn't work.

  - with validation error on step addition, the form is correctly populated, but collapsed

x turn </recipe/{id}> into </recipe/{id}/{safe(name)}>

- focus improvements

  - /user/{user} 
    - next action

  x /user/{user}/brew/{id}
    x page load -> "edit brew details"
    x add step -> first step form
    x step form cancel -> "edit brew details"

  - /recipe/{id}/{text}
    x top actions
    x edit details -> :input:first
    - GET after POST of {grain, hop, …} -> [add] button on same form.

Bugs
----
x Recipe* amounts can't be sub-integer, which makes it hard to have "0.5 oz" of hops. :(

Weirdness
---------
- when journaling after racking to secondary, is it entered as primary-ferm or secondary-ferm?
